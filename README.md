# Battleship-Simulator

just a small personal project to try to simulate/evaluate different battleship algorithms

game is currently set up with normal battleship rules, but grid size, number of ships, sizes of ships etc can be changed

to make or test out your own algorithm, just add a new static method to TargetingAlgorithms.java
