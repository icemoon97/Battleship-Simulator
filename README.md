# Battleship-Simulator

Just a small personal project to try to simulate/evaluate different battleship algorithms

All algorithms and graphics are currently set up with normal battleship rules, game and ships objects are step up to work with different grid sizes, numbesr of ships, sizes of ships, etc.

To make your own algorithms, just extend TargetingAlgorithm.java (for targeting algorithms) or PlacingAlgorithms.java (for placing Algorithms).
